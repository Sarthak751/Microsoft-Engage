Microsoft Engage 2022 - **"Three-step super secure authentication system"**   
Hosted on github: [Face Recognition WebApp](https://sarthak751.github.io/My-Project/)

## Overview
I made this application as a part of Microsoft Engage Intern 2022 Program. I originally wanted to make an attendance monitoring system using facial recognition in addition to the authenticatin system, but due to time constraints I had to work solely on the authentication system. But hey, I just improved it to the next level! Check out the content below for more information about the system.

## Tech Stack
I can't deny that I used the most traditional way of doing things but it did turn out quite well. I used:

* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* Google Firebase (Authentication and Storage)
* MXFace API (Kudos to these guys for such a nice and sweet documentation)

## 3-step authentication
In very simple terms, this is how the application flows: 

1. Email and Password login
2. Username login
3. Face login

## Requirements
This project is just a collection of web pages built using the good old combination of html, css and javascript. All you need to do is clone the repo and run the project. As
easy as that.


## File Structuring

Since the project does not have too many pages, I clubbed all the same extension files together, for example, all css files together. The html files sit at the root level of
the file structure. Some people could have a hard time figuring out what files are linked to what files. For such people, I have also made a nice diagram given below:

## User Flow Diagram

I have also made a nice hand-drawn user flowchart which does make things a little simple to understand.
