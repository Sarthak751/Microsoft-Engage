## Overview
I made this application as a part of Microsoft Engage Intern 2022 Program. It is an attendance system using facial recognition technology. The X-factor about this project is the fact that there are actually two places where facial recognition has been used:
* To mark the attendance of the employees by scanning their faces
* For logging in the admins (let's say, managers) through a two-step authentication process, first by typing in the correct email and password, followed by a facial recognition test
