Microsoft Engage 2022 - Three-step super secure authentication system       
Link to the application: [Face Recognition WebApp](https://sarthak751.github.io/My-Project/)

## Overview
I made this application as a part of Microsoft Engage Intern 2022 Program. I originally wanted to make an attendance monitoring system using facial recognition in addition to the authenticatin system, but due to time constraints I had to work solely on the authentication system. But hey, I just improved it to the next level! Check out the content below for more information about the system.

## Tech Stack
I can't deny that I used the most traditional way of doing things but it did turn out quite well. I used:

*HTML
*CSS
*Javascript
*Google Firebase (Authentication and Storage)
*MXFace API (Kudos to these guys for such a nice and sweet documentation)

## 3-step authentication
In very simple terms, this is how the application flows: 

1. Email and Password login
2. Username login
3. Face login

## File Structuring

Since the project does not have too many pages, I clubed all the same extension files together, for example, all css files together. The html files sit at the root level of
the file structure. Some people could have a hard time figuring out what files are linked to what files. For such people, I have also made a nice diagram given below:
